# King Taipan - a Python botnet  

Currently under development, no functional release yet.

## Current Functionality:  
Operate the Command & Control server via a command line interface (CLI).  
The interface includes all commands and documentation.  
Most of the commands invoke the C&C functionality through a REST API. 

## In development (via Issues):  
* Format the botnet into a portable version which can be deployed to client machines
* Establish connection to a remote client  
* Develop CLI command to list clients with an established connection to the C&C server  
* Server functionality - Update client with a new version of the whole botnet or a specific functionality (screenshot, keylogger ..)   
* Develop CLI command to update clients  
* Develop botnet features - webcam, screenshot, bitcoin miner ..   
* Develop CLI command to install features on the client
